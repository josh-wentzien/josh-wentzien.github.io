Screenshot of Winter 2023 time schedule: This was a quarter of decision-making
for me. I was taking two CSE and two EE classes and would find out midway
through the quarter whether I was accepted into the Allen School or not. I was
ready to go either way, but it is certainly an inflection point.

Photo of Acoustiic: This was where I worked over the summer over 2023. It
cemented in my mind that I had made the right decision by switching majors, and
has also led me to choosing the job I have after graduation (at a startup
instead of a giant firm).
