in college, which happened to be for Math 125, also known as Calculus II. The
rest of the test was unmarked, but the TA that graded this particular problem
left a comment about how I did get a correct answer, but did it in an arduous,
unnecessarily complicated way. It’s strange, but I feel like this introduced me
to the humanity of the TAs (especially with the smiley face). It also reminded
that although there may be more than one way to skin a cat, there are definitely
better methods and worse methods.</p><figure class=small-image><img src=/images/scorecard.png><figcaption><h4>Duplicate Bridge scorecard.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>This is the score card for the first duplicate bridge event that I attended,
demonstrating what contracts were landed in each time, and the resulting score
from the playing-out of that contract. Whenever I return to my grandparents’
house in St. Louis, Missouri, we often play rubber bridge, and I wanted to
develop my skills further in college. As such, I decided to go to a duplicate
bridge club, which turned out to be a much more competitive setting, which is
both stressful and invigorating.</p><figure class=small-image><img src=/images/dausgaard.jpeg><figcaption><h4>A program from the Seattle Symphony.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>This is the program for the second time I went to Benaroya Hall this quarter,
for the titular event where Thomas Dausgaard conducted Brahm&rsquo;s First Symphony. I
am somewhat frugal and of course living on a budget but through the use of
TeenTix, tickets for certain events cost only $5, which is completely worth it.
Classical music isn&rsquo;t my favorite genre of music (I prefer jazz), but I believe
it is important to be aware of it and appreciate it, and there is no better way
than going to concerts. I also find that the people who attend these are
interesting to talk to: one lady asked me about my own career goals with
bioengineering, and we had a conversation about the consequences of unethical
bioengineers, which I hadn&rsquo;t thought about before.</p><div class=post-navigation><span class="btn prev disabled">← Previous</span>
