in college. The rest of the test was unmarked, but the TA that graded this
particular problem left a comment about how I did get a correct answer, but did
it in an arduous, unnecessarily complicated way. It’s strange, but I feel like
this introduced me to the humanity of the TAs (especially with the smiley face).
It also reminded me that although there may be more than one way to skin a cat,
there are definitely better methods and worse methods.</p><figure class=small-image><img src=/images/scorecard.png><figcaption><h4>Duplicate Bridge scorecard.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>This is the score card for the first duplicate bridge event that I attended,
demonstrating what contracts were landed in each time, and the resulting score
from the playing-out of that contract. Whenever I return to my grandparents’
house in St. Louis, Missouri, we often play rubber bridge, and I wanted to
develop my skills further in college. As such, I decided to go to a duplicate
bridge club, which turned out to be a much more competitive setting. Although I
ended up only playing duplicate bridge for this first quarter of college, it was
an entertaining experience, and my grandmother does appreciate my knowledge of
the Stayman convention, Jacoby transfer, Blackwood, et cetera.</p><iframe src=/pdfs/engl282_reflection.pdf width=100% height=600px>This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it:

with material through the analytical framework of disability. Before this class,
I had not engaged with media like text, podcasts, visuals expliciting through
the lenses of multimodality and disability, and by approaching material in this
way, it allowed me to have fresh ideas and new thoughts about how we can use the
the two to improve how media works for everyone. I believe that in general, when
we take assumptions that are implicit in our work and then make them explicit,
it improves quality because we must then consider whether or not the assumptions
which we are making are actually reasonable for what we are trying to do. By its
very nature, it is not easy to always take our assumptions into account, but
through doing it time and time again, one&rsquo;s ability to do so is strengthened,
and this class certainly allowed me to improve in that regard.</p><figure class=small-image><img src=/images/chipotle.jpeg><figcaption><h4>A photo of me at Chipotle on one of my last days of work.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>As a freshman who had only taken introductory STEM classes and additionally
didn&rsquo;t know when the recruiting season was, I did not have a technical
internship after my first year. Wanting to still have some job experience so as
to bolster my résumé for the next year, I decided to work at Chipotle, and work
at Chipotle I did. With a summer full of 3pm-11pm shifts, I quickly found out
how difficult working food service was, and how strongly I desired to not repeat
this experience. There are simply some things that you must learn by doing, and
I do credit this summer job with a lot of my work ethic to find a job that
relates to my field of study.</p><div class=post-navigation><span class="btn prev disabled">← Previous</span>
